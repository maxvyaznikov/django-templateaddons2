Template tags:

* resolve: tag is to resolve variable names

* call: tag is to call functions with parameters


*******
resolve

This template tag was took from this answer:
http://stackoverflow.com/a/13771503/2261861 And can be used in such cases:

.. code-block:: django

    {% resolve some_list some_index as value %}
    {% resolve some_dict some_dict_key as value %}

...


*******
call
*******

This template tag was created because of default django behavior with functions.
You can call it only without parameters or create a tag on it. So, now we can
pass arguments into `call`-tag and receive result as variable.

.. code-block:: django

    {% call context.fn arg1 arg2 as value %}

...
